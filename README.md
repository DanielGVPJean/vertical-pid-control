# Vertical flight control using a PID controller

This is still in development and it's been moved from local to this repository, so some files might be missing or the file tree might be messy.

>## Description
>
>This project uses one brushless motor mounted on a vertical rail. The main focus is to create a control system that allows the motor to stay at a given height and respond to disturbances.
>
>The project works using two main modules
>
>1. User Interface, which lets you set the desired height and also modify the P, I and D constants.
>2. The vertical control model receives the data given through the interface and acts accordingly.
